        <p class="mt-2">
            I am an electrical engineering student at the University of Iowa. Before coming to university I gained experience working at an agricultural engineering facility, 
            and also spent 3 months working with frontend mobile app developers.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">During the Summer of 2022, I lived in Eswatini for a civil engineering project building a 67 meter pedestrian footbridge. 
                        This allowed me an introduction to civil design concepts, construction management, and international nonprofit functions.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">In my studies, I have acquired knowledge and experience in a variety of electrical engineering topics including 
                        analog circuit design, digital signal processing, communications systems, and RF electronics. I'm in the field of 
                        electrical engineering specifically because I have a passion for building analog music equipment.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl sm:text-xl xs:text-lg mb-4 font-bold mt-4">Hobbies</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">In my free time my main hobby is the study of music. I have been a jazz guitarist for my whole life, and work as a teacher 
                        of drums, guitar, bass, and piano to people of all ages. </p>
        <p class="mt-2">I am also incredibly interested in the study of languages, and have achieved fluency in French and differing degrees of competency in Spanish, Portuguese, and SiSwati.  </p>
        <p class="mt-2"> I love learning about anything that catches my attention including analog electronics, cooking, literature, and painting.</p>

        <p class="mt-2">Shown above is the prototype of a handheld infrared transmitter and it's paired receiver. The receiver's filter stages were designed using knowledge gained from Anton Kruger's "Electronic Circuits" course.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">It functioned at around 10 feet away even in the presence of ambient light and intentional interference.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Project 2</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">Here is an image of the project I'm most proud of. This was a year long design project of a 67-meter span 
                        pedestrian footbridge located in Godloza, Eswatini. </p>
        <p class="mt-2"> I was the manager of logistics and cultural relations for this 8-week construction project. The bridge was built in a location where about a dozen people including 
                        children had died attempting to cross a river in order to access vital resources on the other side.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">The project gave me experience with civil engineering concepts, construction management, and cultural relations in the 
                        context of an internation non-profit. This project was facilitated by Engineers in Action and Bridges to Prosperity.</p>

        <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mt-4">Project 3</h3>
        <p class="mt-2">Before coming to university, I worked as a quasi-intern in frontend design at an agricultural engingeering company called ControlTech in Bondurant, Iowa. </p>
        <p class="mt-2"> In that time I learned about production processes, and created a remote control interface and a chart system displaying live data. We used C++ and an Angular 4 framework.</p>
