<h2>Project Highlights</h2>
<ul class="project-list">
<li>Project 1: Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signal encoder/decoder using MATLAB. The two functions convert between keypad values (0123456789*#) and audio signals encoded with the corresponding tone pairs. To achieve a robust design, the encoder has extensive input validation and the decoder uses the Fourier Transform to correctly identify any valid signal; a script is included that tests many possible use cases.</li>
<li>Project 2: Graphing voltmeter embedded system using C and AVR Assembly. After the user defines a sampling rate, the system plots data points as they are measured, also recording the data and related statistics for later use. The system logic and OLED interface are programmed in C, whereas the pushbutton debouncing and a few calculation pipelines are written in Assembly.</li>
<li>Project 3: Infrared (IR) transmitter and hardware-filtered IR receiver circuits. When the transmitter sends a 5 kHz signal, the receiver filters and amplifies it, producing a steady output that can drive a load such as a small motor.</li>
</ul>
